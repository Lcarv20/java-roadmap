# JavaRoadmap

This monorepo contains a few toy projects I have been doing to learn more about spring boot ecosystem and java.
Inside the folder packages are the projects, and for better InteliJ experience I advise to open a project at a time instead from the root of this repo.

It is also possible to test the packages via command line running `nx [command] [package]` or using the debugging tools provided by your IDE.
Each project should have details on how to run them.
For that it is needed to (after cloning this repo) install all node dependencies.

------------------------------
The topics I intend to cover are spring web, spring security, lombok, testing, data jpa, hybernate.

The tooling used for this project is docker & docker compose, a node package manager(npm or pnpm), java 17.
